    "The general idea is to create an NLP model to classify Fake News by means of sentence emotional analysis\n",
    "The task-list shall be as following:\n",
    "1. Connect to the DB with  (in this stage we will take the data from files), containing a corpus of texts with fake news. All the news shall be marked as fake or not fake. It may be non-modal (i.e.: probabilistic)\n",
    "2. Prepare the corpus by means of sentence embeddings -> hash -> emotion vector.\n",
    "* remark: we need to define an emotion vector. It cannot be just \"angry\" or \"fun\"\n",
    "3. Each article will be converted to a set of such vectors, representing the emotional span of the article body (drop the title? may-be)\n",
    "4. Classifier will take a set of these vectors and produce a prediction of \"fake/no-fake\" in a probabilistic way.\n",
    "In some point one can train a GAN to generate the fake news with emotional load, considerable to mimic the actual \"fake news\", but not as a beginning"
